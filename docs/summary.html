                        government tried to herd everyone into the cities so we'd be easier to
                        protect. All that did was put all the food in one place. Every time one of
                        those things kills one of us we become one of them. It took a week for just
                        about everyone in the city to be killed. After that... We don't know. Nobody
                        can get in or out. Did you have family in there? </p>
