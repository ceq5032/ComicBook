The Walking Dead Compendium Vol. 01 (2011)Volume 01
Description:
---------------------------

Since its debut in 2003, Robert Kirkman's "The Walking Dead" has redefined the survival horror genre, delivering a unique and gripping narrative set in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event. The series features a diverse and ever-evolving cast of characters, including a substantial number of relentless zombies. However, at its core, "The Walking Dead" revolves around the character of Rick Grimes.

Rick, a former police officer, stands as a husband, father, and the de facto leader of a motley crew of survivors. Their common goal is to carve out a future in a world where the very concept of 'future' has become a fragile commodity. While it's true to label "The Walking Dead" as a zombie story, it delves much deeper, exploring timeless questions about the essence of life and whether it's still attainable in a world teeming with the undead.
