**Description:**
Since its debut in 2003, Robert Kirkman's "The Walking Dead" has redefined the survival horror genre, delivering a unique and gripping narrative set in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event. The series features a diverse and ever-evolving cast of characters, including a substantial number of relentless zombies. However, at its core, "The Walking Dead" revolves around the character of Rick Grimes.

Rick, a former police officer, stands as a husband, father, and the de facto leader of a motley crew of survivors. Their common goal is to carve out a future in a world where the very concept of 'future' has become a fragile commodity. While it's true to label "The Walking Dead" as a zombie story, it delves much deeper, exploring timeless questions about the essence of life and whether it's still attainable in a world teeming with the undead.

**Comic vs. TV Show - Chapter 1:**
The plot of the first chapter of "The Walking Dead" comic is relatively similar to elements of the show's first season. Rick wakes from his coma and stumbles into the new world, meets Morgan and his son, and journeys to Atlanta to find his family. The encounter with Glenn, group bonding, firearms training, and a horde of Walkers attacking are key plot points.

**Differences from the Show:**
While Chapter 1 of the comic closely follows the show's first season, there are some differences in character introductions, the reunion with family, and the exploration of group dynamics. The comic provides a more in-depth look at the dynamics between Rick and Shane and the group's interactions.
